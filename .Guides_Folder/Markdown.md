# Markdown

In case of doubts I will follow this [guide](https://markdown.es/sintaxis-markdown/#codigo).

## Include Code

In order to include code in a markdown it could be done by:  
1. Opening and closing with "\`".  
This is similar to HTML "\<code>".
2. Starting a line with 4 spaces.   
This is similar to HTML "\<pre>". Current method is not indicated for multi-line code.
